# Wine Quality Prediction App

This **Wine Quality Prediction** Streamlit app predicts the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using a pre-trained RandomForest model.

## Overview

The app allows users to input values for various wine characteristics (like acidity, sugar, pH, etc.) and returns a quality prediction on a scale of 1 to 10. The model was trained using a dataset of wine samples and aims to help winemakers assess their product quality more effectively.

## Features

- **Interactive Input**: Users can adjust wine property sliders and input fields.
- **Prediction**: The app predicts wine quality using a RandomForest model.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of wine quality distribution.

## Memory Usage

This app was optimized for memory efficiency. Here's an updated look at the memory footprint:
- **Model Size**: The RandomForest model is stored as a pickle file (`wine_quality_model.pkl`), which consumes around **XX MB**.
- **App Runtime Memory**: During prediction, memory usage is minimized through streamlined data handling and efficient Pandas operations.

## Data Description

The dataset used for this app includes the following columns:
- **Fixed Acidity**
