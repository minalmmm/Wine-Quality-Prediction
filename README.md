# Wine Quality Prediction App

This **Wine Quality Prediction** Streamlit app predicts the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using a pre-trained RandomForest model.

## Overview

The app allows users to input values for various wine characteristics (like acidity, sugar, pH, etc.) and returns a quality prediction on a scale of 1 to 10. The model was trained using a dataset of wine samples and aims to help winemakers assess their product quality more effectively.

## Features

- **Interactive Input**: Users can adjust wine property sliders and input fields.
- **Prediction**: The app predicts wine quality using a RandomForest model.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of wine quality distribution.
